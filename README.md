## 🗄️ Data Storage

The application uses a hybrid storage approach:

- **JSON Files**: Initial data structure and seed data
  - `src/data/users.json` - User accounts
  - `src/data/admins.json` - Admin accounts
  - `src/data/issues.json` - Reported issues

- **localStorage**: Runtime data persistence in the browser
- **File System**: Uploaded files stored in `uploads/` directory

All data persists between browser sessions.
